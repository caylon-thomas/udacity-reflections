How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 
It allowed me to see the added and deleted code which is amazing, didn't know that was possible
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: you can save when you want, know when it is important to save, helps yout track your thought process, etc.
